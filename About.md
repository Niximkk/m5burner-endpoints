# About the repo:

ℹ️ M5Burner is a tool designed for managing and burning firmware to M5Stack devices.

⚠️ Using wireshark, I was able to capture requests made by M5Burner, and I discovered that these requests don't need any authentication. So any user can create projects in the name of other users or even delete and modify existing projects of other users.

🟣 You can use softwares like insomnia to make all the listed requests.
